# 🤖 Intelligent Navigation RL Research  

"To address the challenges of low learning efficiency and poor generalization in reinforcement learning for visual navigation tasks, we focus on image-goal navigation in the Habitat simulator and explore a technical pathway from model-free to model-based reinforcement learning approaches. Compared with existing methods on the image-goal navigation benchmark, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements across three standard benchmark datasets (Gibson, MP3D, and HM3D)."
